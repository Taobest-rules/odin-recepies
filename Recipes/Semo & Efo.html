    <p>Semo and Efo Riro is a beloved Nigerian dish that brings together the smooth, satisfying texture of semolina swallow with the rich, spicy flavors of Efo Riro — a vibrant spinach stew. Efo Riro, which means "stirred leafy vegetable" in Yoruba, is typically made with spinach or fluted pumpkin leaves (ugu), simmered with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and a blend of traditional spices. It often includes assorted meats, fish, and sometimes stockfish, giving it a deep, smoky flavor.

This dish is a staple in many Nigerian households and is enjoyed both for everyday meals and on special occasions. The semo (semolina) serves as the perfect neutral base, used to scoop up generous portions of the flavorful stew by hand — a satisfying, wholesome way to enjoy a truly African culinary experience.</p>
